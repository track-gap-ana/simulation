There was a bug in my old custom PROPOSAL that didn't turn off the LLP xsec after exiting the detector, leading to a majority of the LLPs being produced after the detector. See plots in old vs. new PROPOSAL folders to see the fix.

The error had to do with integration bounds. Check commit notes in icetray/axelpo-main to see exactly what I did but basically the bounds weren't set equal when we wanted to turn off the cross section.
